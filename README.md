# Why this adaptation

For a very practical cource in programming, we found that the original contained a lot of sections not needed by our students to solve everyday scientific problems.

This version has therefore been stripped of chapters that are not necessary for your first steps in python or which distract from the zen of python.

Furthermore, scientifically targeted chapters and appendices have been added, such as chapters on numpy, file handling and curve fitting.
